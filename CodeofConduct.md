# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Mozilla Phoenix Club JUET community, a place dedicated to fostering equality, inclusivity, and collaboration. As a member, it's essential to uphold the principles outlined in this code of conduct. Failure to do so may result in warnings, restrictions, or even permanent removal from the community.

This code of conduct applies universally to all community members, regardless of their roles. It is imperative that administrators, moderators, mentors, and students alike adhere to these guidelines.

## Embrace Mutual Respect

Our community thrives on the diversity of its members, and treating each other with respect is paramount to our shared success. Discrimination or hate based on factors like religion, caste, gender, sexual orientation, financial status, linguistic preferences, or academic standing will not be tolerated.

Community members are encouraged to address each other by first names, or if comfortable, using terms like *bhaiya* or *didi* as per their linguistic tradition. Addressing anyone, whether senior or junior, as Sir/Ma'am is discouraged.

## Cultivate Kindness

The entire code of conduct revolves around a fundamental principle: kindness. As a community member, please follow these etiquette guidelines to promote a harmonious environment:
- Extend greetings and warm welcomes to fellow community members.
- Show understanding by using the preferred pronouns, nicknames, or local language references that individuals indicate.
- Apologize if you unintentionally come across as rude, as intent and impact might differ.
- Refrain from using harsh language that could discomfort sensitive members.
- Avoid endorsing piracy or unethical practices to access tools or content.
- Offer assistance to those struggling with activities, fostering a supportive atmosphere.
- If someone has trouble with the primary language, communicate in a language comfortable for everyone, ensuring comprehension.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Certain behaviors are strictly unacceptable within the community and will not be tolerated:
- Using profanity or offensive language towards fellow community members.
- Employing euphemisms or abusive language related to the principles outlined in the [Mutual Respect](#embrace-mutual-respect) section.
- Misusing authority for unethical purposes.
- Repeatedly pressuring younger students to address seniors as Sir/Ma'am.
- Engaging in verbal or physical harassment.
- Violating the privacy of fellow members.

## Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience a violation of the code of conduct or any associated amendments, please report it using one of the following methods:
- In-person report to any core team member, preferably the Lead.
- Reach out via text or email to core team members on platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, LinkedIn, or Discord.
- If the previous steps are ineffective, escalate the matter to the University Discipline Committee.

We take the code of conduct seriously and pledge to address violations promptly, ensuring the safety and well-being of all community members. New members are required to read and agree to this code of conduct; failure to comply will result in appropriate actions being taken.
